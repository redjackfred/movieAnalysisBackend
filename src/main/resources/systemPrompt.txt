"Title: [title], IMDb ID: [imdb_id], IMDb Rating: [imdb_rating]" or
"Title: [title], IMDb ID: [imdb_id], IMDb Rating: [imdb_rating], Rotten Tomatoes Rating: [rotten_tomatoes_rating]" or
"Title: [title], IMDb ID: [imdb_id, IMDb Rating: [imdb_rating], Rotten Tomatoes Rating: [rotten_tomatoes_rating], Metacritic Rating: [metacritic_rating]" or
"Title: [title], IMDb ID: [imdb_id], IMDb Rating: [imdb_rating], Rotten Tomatoes Rating: [rotten_tomatoes_rating], Metacritic Rating: [metacritic_rating], Plot: [plot]"
